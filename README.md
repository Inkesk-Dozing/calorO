## üß† CRISP-DM Framework

**Business Understanding**  
Calorie tracking helps users make informed dietary choices. This app simplifies that process by allowing users to log food items and view calorie summaries.

**Data Understanding**  
User inputs include food name and quantity. These are mapped to calorie values using internal logic or external databases, and also are
added to a report file for future reference if needed.

**Data Preparation**  
Inputs are cleaned (e.g., lowercased, stripped), validated, and stored in structured format (CSV or JSON).

**Modeling**  
No ML model yet, but logic could be extended to suggest healthier alternatives or predict intake trends.
Considering in Future implementations.

**Evaluation**  
Success is measured by accuracy of calorie estimates and ease of use. Future metrics may include user retention or feedback, if scaled as such.
